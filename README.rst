Overview
========

MSG (Multidimensinal Stellar Grids) is a library that synthesizes
astrophysical spectra and photometric colors via interpolation in
pre-calculated grids.  Given a set of stellar atmospheric parameters
(e.g., effective temperature, gravity and metallicity), MSG can
calculate the specific intensity of the emergent radiation field as a
function of wavelength and angle. It can also convolve these data with
appropriate filters and response functions, to evaluate colors in a
wide variety of photometric systems.
