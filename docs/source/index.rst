MSG (`Madison Spectral Grids`) is a software library and a set of data
products that together provide the capability to synthesize stellar
spectra over a wide range of input parameters. The synthesis is
performed via cubic interpolation in multi-dimensional grids of
pre-calculated intensity (or flux) spectra. MSG is desgined to offer
high performance, accuracy and flexibility while remaining
easy to install and use.
