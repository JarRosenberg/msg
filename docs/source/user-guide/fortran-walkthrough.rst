This chapter provides a walkthrough of using the Fortran MSG interface
to evaluate intensity and flux spectra for a model of Sirius (alpha
Canis Majoris).

Downloading the Demo Grid
=========================

The demo grid is a small, low-resolution temperature-gravity grid of
intensity spectra, useful for learning about MSG's
capabilities. Download the grid from here (it's size is around 100
MB); you can store it in any directory, but make a note of where
you've put it.

Writing the Code
