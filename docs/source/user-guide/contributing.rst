Code
====

To contribute code toward the MSG project, from bug fixes through to
major new features, the preferred method is the standard
fork---branch---pull-request paradigm described `here
<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project>`__. If
your pull request languishes for more than a couple of weeks without
receiving a response, consider opening an issue to give the developers
a nudge.

Documentation
=============

To contribute documentaion toward the project, follow the same
approach as above for code. (The ReStructured Text source files for
the documentation reside in the :file:`docs/source` subdirectory.)

Data
====

To contribute data toward the project (in the form of spectral
intensity or flux grids), a number of options are available depending
on your level of technical expertise. Both involve first converting
your data into HDF5 files following the :ref:`specint
<data-schema-specint-files>` data schemas.

Using the Tools
---------------

The easier but less flexible approach is to use one of the :ref:`tools
provided` to convert spectra from a 


Building your Own Tools
-----------------------



the first step
is to create a set of files convert these data into MSG's HDF5-based
`data schema`.
