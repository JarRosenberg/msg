Code
====

To contribute code to the MSG project, from bug fixes through to major
new features, the preferred method is the standard
fork---branch---pull-request paradigm described `here
<https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project>`__. If
your pull request languishes for more than a couple of weeks without
receiving a response, consider :ref:`opening an issue <open-an-issue>`
to give the developers a nudge.

Documentation
=============

To contribute documentation toward the project, follow the same
approach as above for code. (The ReStructured Text source files for
the documentation reside in the :file:`docs/source` sub-directory.)

Data
====

To contribute data toward the project (in the form of spectral
intensity or flux grids), a number of options are available. The
:ref:`data-files-importing` section explains how to import an existing
grid; but if this lies beyond your technical expertise, then the MSG
team will be happy to assist. Either way, if you want to make your
data publicly available and listed in the :ref:`grid-files` chapter,
then please :ref:`open an issue <open-an-issue>`.
