How MSG Works
*************

This chapter provides a walkthrough of using the MSG Python interface
to evaluate flux and intensity spectra for a model of Sirius
(:math:`\alpha` Canis Majoris). The code fragments are presented as a
sequence of Jupyter notebook cells, but pasting all of the fragments
into a Python script should work also.

* Limb darkening functions

Interpolation in Wavelength
===========================

* Conservative rebinning

Interpolation in Other Parameters
=================================

* Tensor product surfaces
