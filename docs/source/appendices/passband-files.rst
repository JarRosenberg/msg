Passband Files

As with the :ref:`grid-files`, the passband files used by MSG are
not shipped as part of the :git:`rhdtownsend/msg` git repository; they
must be downloaded separately. This chapter describes the various
files available for download.

SVO Filter Service Passbands
============================

The `Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO)
<https://svo.cab.inta-csic.es/main/index.php>`__ offers a `database
<http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/svo/theory/fps3/index.php?mode=browse>`__
of filters and calibrations for a wide array of photometric
systems. The table below provides links to tar archives of passband
files created for selected systems in the SVO database. For each
filter of each system, separate passband files for the Vega, AB and ST
magnitude systems are provided.

Ad-Hoc Passbands
================

There are a few gaps in the SVO database, which the following passband
files aim to address.
