Missing ``forum.inc``
=====================

During compilation, if the error ``include file 'forum.inc' not
found`` arises then it's likely you have an incomplete copy of the
source code. Verify that when you :ref:`checked out <github-access>`
the code from GitHub, you used the :option:`--recurse-submodules`
option.

Other Issues
============

If you encouter something else that doesn't work as it should, please
:git:`open an issue <rhdtownsend/msg/issues>`.
