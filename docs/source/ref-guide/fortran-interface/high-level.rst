Fortran High-Level Interface
============================

The Fortran high-level interface, provided by the :f:mod:`fmsg_m`
module, is suitable for most end-user applications. It comprises
derived type definitions for the :f:type:`specgrid_t` and
:f:type:`photgrid_t` types (inherited from the :ref:`low-level
interface <fortran-low-level>`) together with support routines and
constants.
